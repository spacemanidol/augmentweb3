	<h1>Hi there, I'm Daniel Campos!</h1>
	<p>I am a technologist and tinkerer currently located in Urbana, Illinois. I love to get nerdy about beverages, financial systems, the nature of intelligence, sports involing boards.</p>
	<p>I'm working toward a PhD in Computer Science at <a href='https://cs.illinois.edu/'>UIUC</a> under <a href='http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html'>Prof. Heng Ji</a> and I work on model compression at <a href='https://neuralmagic.com/'>Neural Magic</a>.</p>
	<p>My primary interests lie in the intersection of efficient models, natural language processing and information understanding systems(IR, IE, etc.)</p>
